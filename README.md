  Hi, I’m @Edinhogtb
  I’m interested in learning new programming languages
  I’m currently learning python and html
  I’m looking to collaborate on data science and gaming development
  How to reach me: edinhogtneto@gmail.com
  
  I'm a 19y old student, who lives in Brazil, i locked up college and spend by now 70% of my time learning how to program, im really into this programming world and i will try, if i remeber, to take notes about my evolution on programming languages, i hope my decision don't frustrate me in the future.
